  title: Still Life with a Guitar
  description: ' "Still Life with a Guitar" (1913) by Juan Gris stands as a quintessential
    example of Cubism, a movement co-founded by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque,
    to which Gris contributed profoundly. This painting, created during a pivotal
    year in Gris''s career, exemplifies his meticulous and mathematical approach
    to Cubism, differentiating him from his contemporaries by his clearer and more
    systematic method.'
