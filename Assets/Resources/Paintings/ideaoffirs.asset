  title: The Idea of Firs
  description: Paul Klee was a Swiss-born German artist. His highly individual style
    was influenced by movements in art that included expressionism, cubism, and surrealism.
    Klee was a natural draftsman who experimented with and eventually deeply explored
    color theory, writing about it extensively; his lectures Writings on Form and
    Design Theory (Schriften zur Form und Gestaltungslehre), published in English
    as the Paul Klee Notebooks, are held to be as important for modern art as Leonardo
    da Vinci's A Treatise on Painting for the Renaissance. He and his colleague,
    Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, both taught at the Bauhaus school of art,
    design and architecture in Germany. His works reflect his dry humor and his sometimes
    childlike perspective, his personal moods and beliefs, and his musicality.
