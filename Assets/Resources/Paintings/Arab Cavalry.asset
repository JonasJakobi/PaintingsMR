  artist: Wassily Kandinsky
  title: Arab Cavalry
  description: The painting you've shared, titled "Arab Calvary," was created by
    Wassily Kandinsky in 1905. This work is quite distinct from his later abstract
    compositions, as it vividly portrays a group of Arab horsemen in motion, with
    expressive, somewhat stylized figures and a sense of dynamic activity.
