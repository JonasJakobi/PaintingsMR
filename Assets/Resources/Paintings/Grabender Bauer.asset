  title: Grabender Bauer
  description: "Ernst Ludwig Kirchner was a German expressionist painter and printmaker
    and one of the founders of the artists group Die Br\xFCcke or \"The Bridge\",
    a key group leading to the foundation of Expressionism in 20th-century art. He
    volunteered for army service in the First World War, but soon suffered a breakdown
    and was discharged. His work was branded as \"degenerate\" by the Nazis in 1933,
    and in 1937 more than 600 of his works were sold or destroyed."
