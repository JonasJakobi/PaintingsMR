  title: Saul and David
  description: The painting depicts Saul, the king of the Israelites. He is visually
    touched by the harp playing. The depicted situation comes from 1 Samuel 16:14-23
    and 1 Samuel 18:8-11, in which King Saul is abandoned by the Holy Spirit, and
    God sends him an evil spirit. It taunts Saul, and only David's harp playing can
    relax him. Later David married Michal, one of Saul's daughters. He eventually
    succeeded his father-in-law as King of the Israelites.
